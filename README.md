# Restaurants-Transit
The app is simple restaurants locator, display map annotations for a currently hardcoded set of 5 restaurants.  
Each restaurant annotations includes the restaurant name, an image and its coordinates, allowing the annotation view to calculate and display the ETA between the current user location and the restaurant location.  
Each map annotation also displays a transit icon, which will open the iOS Map app with a direction mode (transit) and the restaurant location to automatically the route to the user.

This app was originally created for a tutorial purpose on [Sweettutos.com][1].  
The code has been largely refactored by myself in order to provide a better architecture and divise responsibilities.
